In the beginning...

The beginning wasn't established not to long ago. Technology and the web have exponentially improved over the years to bring us to where we are now. I'd like to think that a lot of what we know now will one day be outdated. Anyway, thank you to those who paved the way, so I can be here typing this. This? This is my beginning. Whether or not it's noted, I will make my mark on the world. So, HELLOOOOO WORLD!
